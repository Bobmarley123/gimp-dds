Requirements
=======================================

The only required packages that must be installed to build the plugin
(besides Gtk+ and the GIMP) are:
  
  1) gimp version 2.8 or later
  2) pkg-config version 0.14 or later

You will need to install the development packages for your distribution for
Gtk+, Glib and GIMP.


Building for Windows with mingw
=======================================

To compile the plugin for use with the Windows version of GIMP you'll need
to use the MingW environment (http://www.mingw.org).  You'll need to install
the runtime and development packages for the following libraries:

   1) gimp 2.8.x
   2) glib2
   3) gtk+2
   4) pango
   5) atk
   6) pkg-config
   
To build, type "make"
     
Installation
=======================================

1. Type 'make' to build the plugin
2. Type 'make install' to install the plugin. By default the plugin will be
installed in your GIMP user plugin directory ($HOME/.gimp-2.8/plug-ins).  If
you want to install the plugin system-wide, as root you must manually copy the
plugin to the system GIMP plugin directory.
